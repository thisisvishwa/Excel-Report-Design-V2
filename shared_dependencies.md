1. **Shared Data Schemas**: All the models (report_designer, data_source, report_structure, excel_field, report_parameters, advanced_features, output_customization, distribution_integration, configuration_management) will likely share a common schema for basic fields such as 'name', 'description', 'create_date', 'write_date', etc.

2. **Shared Function Names**: Functions like 'create', 'write', 'unlink', 'copy' will be shared across all models. Additionally, functions related to report generation, such as 'generate_report', 'get_data', 'format_output', etc., will be shared across relevant models and controllers.

3. **Shared Message Names**: Error and success messages like 'ValidationError', 'AccessError', 'SuccessMessage' will be shared across models and controllers.

4. **Shared DOM Element IDs**: The JavaScript file (report_designer.js) will interact with the XML view files. Common DOM elements like 'report_designer_form', 'data_source_form', 'report_structure_form', etc., will be shared across these files.

5. **Shared Exported Variables**: Variables like 'ReportDesigner', 'DataSource', 'ReportStructure', etc., representing the models, will be shared across Python and JavaScript files.

6. **Shared Security Rules**: The security file (ir.model.access.csv) will define access rules for all models, sharing the model names and access levels (read, write, create, unlink).

7. **Shared Test Cases**: The test file (test_report_designer.py) will likely share test cases for common operations like creation, modification, deletion, and report generation.

8. **Shared Demo Data**: The demo data file (report_designer_demo.xml) will share the structure of demo data across all models.

9. **Shared CSS Classes**: The CSS file (report_designer.css) will define styles for shared classes used in the XML view files, such as 'oe_form_field', 'oe_listview_row', etc.
